* Plan

** How to .include?
use a -include switch

** Dot assignments for program counter manipulation
when generating() assignments, usually nothing is emitted.  There is
one exception, that is with dot assignments.  

.=.+4

this should notify the assembler to increment the program counter.

** How to do macros 
*** Macro observations

**** macros don't return values
**** they can expand other macros.
**** Overriding
the macro bindings override global symbols within the scope of the
macro.  OK, so when replacing idents, it's important to prevser the
idents inside the macro ast that are contained the macro argument list.

**** Macros can't define their own macros.
**** Macros can't introduce symbols into main symbol table.
**** Macros maintain a local symbol table.
